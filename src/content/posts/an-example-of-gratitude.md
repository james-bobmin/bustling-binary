### gratitude

I am grateful you are reading this amazing peice of ramble that is spewing out of my fingers at 0254, I actually _had_ to write this as a web based thing as SMS can't handle the pure nonsense that is jimbob. She put him to bed, between two bits of bread.
I am grateful for people like Kerry McGranaghan and Zack Ready for showing me artists I truly admire, I am amused to death and listening to "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking"... lets think about that Title for a second, Hitching up with someone (my sponsor) and Hiking (my journey) Only the dead go free.
I am grateful for using github copiolot, without that I would not be able to roll back my blob website to a version that did not include the CMS

```console

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>
Or undo this operation with:
  git switch -
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
HEAD is now at f2f6e44 another update and reduced size of pics

## honour among thieves

This gratitude was brought to you by God, if you have a problem with that, that is ok, I understand, but this is my reality now and that is why I had to wake upon praying to do thy will at 0200:

## the remains of our love

Roger Waters
Track 6 on The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking
Producers
Roger Waters & Michael Kamen

[Jade:] Are we going to go now?
[Man:] Where would you like to go, darling?
[Wife:] Mmm…Vermont…Wyoming (yes)
[Man:] Wyoming…uh huh, Children!
[Justin:] What?
[Man:] We're going to Wyoming
Darling…Which way is Wyoming?
[Wife:] Hook a right here
You're going the wrong way
[Man:] I know that
I know children…
Let's see how many Volvo's we pass
On the way to our new life in the country
…One
[Wife:] Jade don't do that, that's really negative

## fair bridge to freedom

![fair bridge to freedo](@/assets/fairbridge.jpg)

Don't panic about the song lyrics, I am going to Fairbridge though thank _god_ and my sponsor, fairbridge village year 7 camp was one of the last times I got up in front of a crowd with my friend Dean and did something truly enjoyable [possibly funny] in front of my peers, South Lake primary beat the fuck out of me, I hated that place with a passion, I got punched in the back of the head for no reason one day, I have never had to fight so hard to survive than I did there, I am only just realising that now as I type.

## 0200

I am grateful to be awake at 0200, ok its 0221 now bring on 0222. No more Lying? I don’t even know if that is the right word, isn’t that lying down? Help me!
I am grateful for the Sponsorship literature that is sat in front of me, that I will read after I finish this.
I am grateful this gratitude is so rambling and out there, I needed to get something out of me onto “paper”

## tablet

I am grateful god is delivering me a Samsung (sponsored by whippa and the dingdong only on 92.9 with Kyle the kockmonster) tablet, So I can finally haunt you for ever with my stupid drawings. I know, its a material possession, but it will allow me to easily draw my nonsense, and I can’t wait, but I know I need to be patient, thank you to the Most High Power, universal oneness and love.

## russell brand

I am grateful for Russell Brand; in my active alcoholism I resented how happy that man was, and S shared with me something I needed to hear at the right time to bring me down from the rafters of the monolith. (I should probably share this with him as a sign of my love for him) Thank you.
Thank you for reading all of this, in a different format with a fucking picture of Hugh Grant, if you made it this far without vomiting, well done. Peace and love to you.
I am truly grateful this morning and all mornings going forward

## pure

I am grateful for Pure Writer 2 count the amount of words in this shit, 900+ I have probably never written something so lengthy so fast without hesitation, a feeling I am enjoying and feeling happy content and goosebumpy, whatever that is.

## 0450 (go fishing)

The rest is not mine but you can have it thank you Roger Waters a hero of mine, taken from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking - Roger Waters - 4:50 A.M. (Go Fishing):

```text
[Verse 1]
As cars go by, I cast my mind's eye
Over backpacks on roof racks
Beyond the horizon
Where dream makers
Working in white plastic processors
Invite the unwary
To reach for the pie in the sky
Go fishing, my boy!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
We set out in the spring
With a trunk full of books about everything
About solar devices
And how nice natural childbirth is

[Bridge 1]
We cut down some trees
And we trailed our ideals
Through the forest glade
We dammed up the stream
And the kids cooled their heels
In the fishing pool we'd made

We held hands and we exchanged bands
And we practically lived off the land
You adopted a fox cub
Whose mother was somebody's coat
You fed him by hand
And then snuggled him down
In the grandfather bed while I wrote

[Bridge 2]
And we grew our own maize
And I only occasionally went into town
To stock up on antibiotics
And shells for the shotgun that I kept around
I told the kids stories while you worked your loom
And the sun went down sooner each day

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Father:] Chapter six, in which Eeyore has a birthday and gets two presents
[Child:] Daddy…come on, Dad
[Father:] Eeyore the old grey donkey stood by the side
Of the stream and he looked at himself in the water
“Pathetic”, he said, “That's what it is”
“Good morning Eeyore”, said Pooh
“Oh”, said Pooh. He thought for a long time
[Verse 4]
The leaves all fell down
Our crops all turned brown
It was over
As the first snowflakes fell
I realized all was not well in the camp

[Bridge 3]
The kids caught bronchitis
The space heater ran out of diesel
One weekend, a friend from the East
Rot his soul
Stole your heart
I said, “Fuck it then
Take the kids back to town
Maybe I'll see you around”

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Break]
I said, “Go to him!”
She said, “Okay”

[Outro]
And so, leaving all our hopes and dreams
To the wind and the rain
Taking only our stash
Left our litter and trash
And set out on the road again
On the road again
On the road again
[Child:] Bye bye, Daddy
You can bring Pearl, she's a darn nice girl
But don't bring Lisa
```

Fuck, ok. I think I know why this song was in my head. Love you all, honestly. -jimbob
