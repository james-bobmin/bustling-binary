## the insane person just keeps doing it

That is why I am continuing to write into the void. (not sure why I am putting brackets around this: I was supposed to write after my meeting last night but was a little cooked from the walk)
The void listens to me (ah thats right,I'll get to the point sooner or later, that is if there even is a pointed stick), it might scare the shit out of me right now, but it's the void. It will always be.
Come join me in the void, for a holiday from this three ringed circus.
I will fix this Devile picture when I have dealt with a good case of shopping.

I had my first attempt at trying to reach a seemingly normal person on the bus who expressed his need for help.
I fumbled around a bit, in the end he said he was fine. Continued to play his god song, I think god was due to make an appearance.
When I sat down in a chair i thought: "I still have no idea what I am talking about, then I realised for now keeping in touch with and helping others in and around my recovery is for the best"

There was also people doing the Halloween.
Oh! Just wrote down a bob quote for new website ideas.
I still need to go shopping.
