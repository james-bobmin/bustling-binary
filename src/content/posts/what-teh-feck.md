So, here we are missing blog dates and generally struggling. I am fine, it can't rain all the time. I have been trying another framework? I guess [hexo](https://hexo.io), you know the one right? I thought so. I hit some snags and ended up playing [Once Human](https://www.oncehuman.game/) for a bit, I might go back to that while I wait for my brain to wind-down to a slow whhhiiirrrrrrr-bzzzzz-bopp.
