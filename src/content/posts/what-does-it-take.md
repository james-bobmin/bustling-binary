## I know it's not a party if it happens every night

It is 4am good time to write some non-sense into a computer blog screen, I woke up with this in my head.

[this place is a prison](https://youtu.be/NMgoQBHx12g?si=CxLK2YHcDv7mVlaI)

I first heard this while I was an inpatient at Ramsay Clinic Hollywood, just after we had done some Mindful Music Listening with a favourite facilitator. I remember thinking he would have kittens if I had played this. Little did he know, when another facilitator ran the same activity, I made everyone listen to the [Johnny Cash version of Hurt](https://youtu.be/8AHCfZTRGiI?si=o9P6JMmW8yTJJ4RT), not to trigger or cause anyone Hurt, I just thought it was relevant, halfway through I realised it was a mistake, the people that matter to me liked it though. You know who you are.
Once I read the lyrics to "This Place is a Prison" I realised it was a struggle, a struggle I have struggled with.
It has taken me losing almost everything and being "just broken enough" to realise, that is partly why I have started blagging, as I need an outlet.
The modern internet seems like a homogenised, poorly executed vomit stain, give me the wild west of nonsense any day.
I do realise there is good websites out there, I just haven't found too many. If you know of any send them to [locked bag of bees 6699 appletits](mailto:flatlinejim@jraymondt.com) and I will make a GeoCities circle jerk.
