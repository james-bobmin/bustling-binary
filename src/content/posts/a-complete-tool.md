## if it is so toxic

Why is it legal?
Good question, I will let you do your own research, I am not a science.
Jimbob is an alcoholic though, one that wants to get better.
LFG

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

I thought I was going to have time to draw a picture for you on my new tabz0r (I drew.. something hopefully we can look back at this and laugh, if I don't get better maybe someone can take me out the back and shoot me).

### the edit

Trying out apps and of course I run into the ever-present football player rumplestilscourge called advertising, yes, I know you need to make money, yes I would pay, can we please go back to the shareware model try before you buy I refuse to pay any more subscriptions you DOS country-ham. (sorry to my family that don't understand what I am on about, none of this is meant to be understood, merely an outlet for my frustrations and misc. creative shit)

### HAM

It will mostly be country-hams.
I was awake at 0200 again, this time we lacked the energetic force to change the world so I just read the Big Book and read this:

```text page 284 of Alcoholics Anonymous
"After being repeatedly reprimanded at work for being late in the mornings, I made up a story to hide the fact that I was always hung over. I told my manager I had cancer and needed to go to the doctor for treatment every morning. I would say whatever I needed to protect my drinking"
```

Thats me! _*gets out giant internet high lighter*_
I think I was seriously considering calling in dead at one point, amongst other things.

Anyway..
I need to get ready for my first attempt at hosting the online Daily Reflection.

### my bullshit

Then there is this shit I did after the meeting I hosted, this was my attempt to de-stress.

Not sure why I feel so stressed, nobody fell from a cliff, although I had my suspiciouns.
The lack of sleep is definately caught up this time, I need a rest.

PEACE
