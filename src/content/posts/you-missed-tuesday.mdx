Jesus, I think I also missed Monday.
Owell, you'll be ok won't you?
Good.

```console admin@moonfondle:~$ run blags
errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
```

I like to talk to potential scammers on the internet, see what they are slinging at folks
these days. I have recently started to reconnect with family on Facebook (go me!). Needless to say
there is a lot going on with Facebook, mostly scams? Am I right or just losing my marbles?

Don't answer that.

### I got a "free" reading. Copy pasta:

```console Your reading indicates that you may be struggling with feeling abandoned,
ignored or unloved within the relationship. Your abilities are definitely emotions based
which feels to me like an empath or at the very least you're a sensitive and it seems that
 you went through something very difficult emotionally that triggered your awakening.
 This led to a widened perspective so you may be able to see things different
 love than others now or maybe you've even become clairvoyant.
```

```console Unfortunately I see some burdens, an unpleasant duty and possibly some injustice coming up.
You're swinging back into a time where you're taking on too much and have no time
to relax so I don't know if you're having to pick up something to work or if you maybe
need to reevaluate your time management. You might be doing things the hard way and
repressing your feelings about it which is causing blocked energy‚Ä¶
According to my consultation I see that you are born to be great in life and also you
have gifted with a lot spiritual gift üéÅ
```

```console
but it has been cover up by evil darkness since you have been child but you parents
wasnt noticed because theyve not spiritually believe but thanks to your ancestors
because they usually been with you if not so I wouldnt come across your profile also
I see that you been suffering all lot about relationships and financially
```

Firstly, it's the internet, most of that information is probably available via OSINT,
I am a free and open book come at me! @#%&$
