## the desperate experiment of the first blog

So, we went for a walk through Karrgatup(Kings Park), I noted somewhere during the walk I might have a good excuse to do another [Astro] Blog Tutorial, and actually use it for it's intended porpoise. Now, lets get something straight:

- I don't know shit about nothing 🗸
- If you are reading this I hope you are lost. 🗸
- How lost? ⍻
- That is not lost enough. 𐄂
- Goodbye 🗸

### hmmm still here?

Ok, fine. I have been on a little journey of sorts lately.
After nearly a year at the City of Swan (my end-goal late-stage-capatalism job) they let me go.
To say I wasn't too blame for some of what happened, would be misguided and whatever has happened is now done. (letting it all go like turnips in the wind)
Time to start blagging? Blods? deburg do herp de doo.
I have finally found a group of people that accept my many flaws which has inspired me to keep living, as I come to terms with a new way of existing in meatspace, I shall endevour to write the juicy bits down.
Hopefully we can have a laugh together, or seperately if you would prefer, lets not make it weird.
