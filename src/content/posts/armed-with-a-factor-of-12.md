### weather manatee

It was a stormy afternoon in the back paddock, the horses where chomping at the bit and the frogs were alive with stomping.

Here is Carl with the weather:

I did start doing this blogging some time a go as you might be able to tell from the date, soon the Xman will be poking his face in our socks and rubbing our fireplaces with hot deer-glue.
Time to do some more time, that isn't prison-time.

No really, here IS Carl with the weather:

### one of the advantages of not being drunk all the time

Is...
you aren't drunk all the time

Socking, now > loading socks > darning dabs > side-loading manatees

Anyone else remember that song, by the people that were on the side of the highway?

Me Either.

Stay you, and try not to temple the garbage with an outsourced Xmas.

Parabola

We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside...

This holy reality, this holy experience
Choosing to be here in...
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Alive!

In this holy reality, in this holy experience
Choosing to be here in...
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Twirling round with this familiar parable
Spinning, weaving round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
A chance to be alive and breathing

This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
Embrace this moment, remember, we are eternal
All this pain is an illusion
```
