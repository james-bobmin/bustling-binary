11/11 The question of home and away

where is home? (Nicole [of DR online fame] told me I think God wants you to stay home today, but I still tried to control my day, sharing at South Perth HOME) Trust my sponsor, trust his sponsor, trust my fellow alcoholics especially the old timers speaking their lived experience and truth. Trust in a higher power, our higher power. Trust your home your family of alcoholics trust you are in Godâ€™s hands. Walk each other home stay, stay at home in your heart always carry the message with you to the struggling alcoholic and most importantly carry yourself home each and every day, no matter where you are on this blue rock in the infinite expanse. HOME HOME HOME HOMEGROUP. GROUP OF HOMES.
